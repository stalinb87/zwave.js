zwave.js
========
DEPRECATED: this library has been deprecated in favor of [node openzwave](https://github.com/OpenZWave/node-openzwave-shared)

An abstraction library for manage zwave device

Later i will write a documentation, for now you if you wanna know how works, see or run TestZwave.js, all you have to know is the serial port where the zwave usb is and the node id

For learn about the zwave protocol see the following links

- [An introduction to Z-Wave programming in C#](http://www.digiwave.dk/en/programming/an-introduction-to-z-wave-programming-in-c) is in C# but have good info
- [Understanding Z-Wave Networks, Nodes & Devices](http://www.vesternet.com/resources/technology-indepth/understanding-z-wave-networks)
- [Z-Wave Node Type Overview and Network Installation Guide](http://zwave-products.co.uk/online/templatemedia/all_lang/resources/Z-Wave+Node+Type+Overview+and+Network+Installation+Guide.pdf)

For MACs users is necessary to install the following drivers [drivers](http://www.silabs.com/products/mcu/Pages/USBtoUARTBridgeVCPDrivers.aspx) the port will appear like /dev/tty.SLAB_USBtoUART
